## "Testing your code should be as fun and simple as writing it."

# Purpose

We write so many tests in our day; it should be easier.   
Part of the [Alchemy Collection](https://github.com/SirWellington/alchemy), **Alchemy Test** is a Unit Test Library that makes it easier to test your code by providing syntactic sugar for unit-testing and mocking.
